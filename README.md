# HiraganaFlash
:ideograph_advantage: A game for my kids to practice their Japanese literacy. :jp:

Future features:
- Replace img files with svg
- Add sounds 
- Add the remaining 41 Hiragana
- Add different play modes

Known issues:
- New game doesn't reset the game until the game is complete
- There a x number of flash cards, but you will see one more than once due to the likelihood of getting duplicate numbers when randomizing.

Remixed a previous project to create a simple Japanese flash card game
