# HiraganaFlash
:ideograph_advantage: A game for my kids to practice their Japanese literacy. :jp:

Future verisons:
- ~~Add sounds~~
- ~~Add more hiragana (31 left)~~
- Move .png files to folder, fix paths
- Clear known hiragana, move unknown hiragana back into the main area for testing

- Replace img files with svg
- Add different play modes

Known issues:
- ~~New game doesn't reset the game until the game is complete~~
- There a x number of flash cards, but you will see one more than once due to the likelihood of getting duplicate numbers when randomizing.
